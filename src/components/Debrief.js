                <strong> What was the purpose of this study?</strong>
                <br />
                This study aimed to understand how people learn about, make
                sense of, and predict other people’s personality traits, mental
                states, actions, and social situations. You may not have seen
                all of these types of information, but across participants we
                presented each different type through a variety of different
                stimuli, including images, videos, audio, and text. We will
                analyze the responses that you provided to shed light on how the
                mind organizes social knowledge.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>What were our hypotheses?</strong>
                <br />
                We hypothesize that the mind organizes social knowledge in a way
                that is both efficient, and useful for prediction. In this
                context, efficiency means reducing the complexity of the social
                world down to a simple yet accurate summary. Social prediction
                includes predicting how other people will think, feel, and
                behavior in the future, based on what you know about them in the
                past and present. We believe that these two goals of efficiency
                and prediction shape the way that people understand their social
                world.

                <strong> How was this study conducted?</strong>
                <br />
                During the study, you viewed and judged a variety of stimuli and
                rated their social properties. We will analyze these data to
                determine the underlying principles that organize and explain
                your judgements. This will reveal dimensions and process that
                shape social thought.

                <strong>Did we tell you everything?</strong>
                <br /> There was no deception used in this study. Our initial
                description of the study brief to avoid biasing your natural
                responses. We are thus here providing you with a more detailed
                explanation of the study.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Why is this study important? </strong>
                <br /> This study aims to understand the social knowledge people
                use to navigate everyday social life. The way that people's
                minds organize that social knowledge may help explain a wide
                range of important behaviors. For example, some social biases
                are thought to arise in part because the mind oversimplifies
                aspects of the social world. If we can understand how these
                processes play out, we may learn to more accurately predict and
                change them.

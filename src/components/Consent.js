                <strong> Study Summary: </strong>
                <br />
                This study aims to understand how people perceive and predict
                other people and social situations. The risk of participating in
                this study is minimal, no greater than what you would experience
                in the course of everyday internet use for an equivalent period
                of time. Your participation in this study is completely
                voluntary. You many choose not to participate. You may withdraw
                at any time during the study without penalty by simply closing
                this tab or window of your web browser.

                <strong> What is the purpose of this study? </strong>
                <br />
                The purpose of the study is to understand how people learn about
                and make sense of other people’s traits (e.g., extraversion),
                mental states (thoughts and feelings), actions (running, eating
                talking etc.), and social situations (e.g. dinner with friends).
                We also hope to learn how these processes apply to nonhuman
                objects and entities (such as computer avatars, algorithms,
                pets, and graphs).

                <br />
                Your participation in this study will last approximately [value
                between 5 and 60 inserted here, as appropriate] minutes. You
                will begin by reading the study instructions. You will then make
                judgments about trait, mental states, actions, and/or
                situations, or nonsocial object or entities (such computer
                avatars, algorithms, pets, and graphs). The stimuli may be
                presented through a variety of different media, including text,
                images, videos, and audio. You will make your responses using
                your keyboard/mouse or touchscreen. At the end of the study, you
                will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire about yourself,
                relating information such as your demographics, personality
                traits, mental state, and attitudes.

                <br />
                The risk of participating in this study is minimal. All stimuli
                you will be presented with are selected to avoid any sensitive
                content, such as violence. You will not be asked to provide any
                sensitive information about yourself either.

                data collection is complete, and will not be shared.
